# Tmux-Sessionizer (tms)

# What is this?

Tmux Sessionizer is a Tmux-Session-Manager that is based on ThePrimeagen's tmux-sessionizer script but is highly configurable and includes several more useful functions. You can easily spin up a new Tmux session with a pre-defined layout by running `tms`. You can create a new session with an interactive TUI by running `tms create`. You can easily "drop" your current session and switch to another with `tms kill`. You can create and edit your config file with `tms config init` and `tms config edit`. You can seamlessly switch between active sessions with `tms switch`. And there is more to come!
